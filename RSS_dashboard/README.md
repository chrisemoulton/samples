# RSS Dashboard

This is a sample project called the RSS Dashboard that demonstrates how to combine different algorithms for use on and with the web. 

The algorithms we are using are:
* [Scrape RSS](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/tags/ScrapeRSS)
* [HTML 2 Text](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/util/Html2Text)
* [Autotag](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/AutoTag)
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis)
* [Summarizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer)

You can see a live version of this demo at [RSS Dashboard](https://algorithmia.com/demo/rss).

Included in this directory is a sample project for you to hack on and try out the different algorithms as well as a "completed" portion that you can sneak a peek at if you need to!

This project is intented to be used as part of a workshop, but if you have any questions feel free to email our developer evangelist at lizr@algorithmia.com.
